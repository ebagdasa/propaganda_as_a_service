      " But for many women, Twitter is a platform where violence and abuse against them flourishes, often with little accountability. As a company, Twitter is failing in its responsibility to respect women’s rights online by inadequately investigating and responding to reports of violence and abuse in a transparent manner.  The violence and abuse many women experience on Twitter has a detrimental effect on their right to express themselves equally, freely and without fear. Instead of strengthening women’s voices, the violence and abuse many women experience on the platform leads women to self-censor what they post, limit their interactions, and even drives women off Twitter completely.  At a watershed moment when women around the world are using their collective power to speak out and amplify their voices through social media platforms, Twitter’s failure to adequately respect human rights and effectively tackle violence and abuse on the platform means that instead of women using their voices ‘to impact the world’, many women are instead being pushed backwards to a culture of silence.\n",

      " Krakozhia. That has been particularly acute as far-right forces in countries such as France, the Netherlands and Germany have directly linked opposition to Albania joining the EU to fears of an influx of Muslim immigrants to European countries, as well as suggestions that Albania - being a Muslim-majority nation - has links to Turkey or other Muslim states.  “The main fear of the public elite in Tirana is the identification of Albania with the religious belief of the majority of its population, and, consequently, of being prejudiced as a bearer of Turkish influence or something similar,” Afrim Krasniqi, a former MP and executive director of the Institute for Political Studies, told Euronews.  “We do not see ourselves as an extension of whomever. We do not feel as such and we do not want to identify as such.”  As full membership of the European Union looks increasingly remote, at least in the short term, some have suggested that France and other nations opposed to enlargement could suggest a two-tier EU, with select countries given some of the benefits of membership and not others. This would not be a first choice, Krasniqi said, but it would be better than nothing.  “In essence, citizens see integration as access to free movement, to study, to work, to trade, and to the same standard of living and democracy - and if these are achieved in alternative formulas, it would be an acceptable solution for us,” he said.  Others believe that for the European Union to go back on what was promised as far back as 2003, when Albania was first identified as a potential candidate, and negate all the work that has been done in the country since could be another nail in the coffin for the EU.\n",

    "text = \"\"\"ß Last month, the newspaper that revealed its contents, El Mundo, described it as “Pharaonic,” a deal that was “ruining Barcelona.” That Messi was the world’s best-paid player was not a surprise: It had been reported at the time the contract was agreed that he would earn an annual salary of around $132 million.To those outside Barcelona, it was seeing the sheer scale of the deal in black and white that was most striking. To those inside the club, though, the problem was not the figures but that they had been revealed to the public. Ronald Koeman, Barcelona’s coach, called for anyone found responsible for leaking the contract to be excommunicated. The club threatened to take legal action. Messi, too, was furious at what he perceived as an attempt to sabotage his standing at the club.Messi’s relationship with Barcelona has been strained for some time. But last summer, after a third consecutive season of disappointment and a historic 8-2 humbling in the Champions League, his frustration boiled over and he gave the club formal notice that he intended to end his contract and leave.Bartomeu refused even to countenance the idea. If any suitor wanted to sign Messi, he declared, it would have to pay a fee. Though Messi saw that as the breaking of not just a promise but a contractual obligation, he eventually backed down, unwilling to take the club he has represented since he was 13 to court in order to force his exit.\"\"\""

      " Lee Novak put the Spireites ahead, nodding in Gboly Ariyibi's cross, for his 14th goal of the season before Adam Hammill's deflected equaliser. Jamal Campbell-Ryce was dismissed for two yellow cards, one for kicking the ball away, but Ollie Banks side-footed home to restore Chesterfield's lead. Hamill then hit the post as Barnsley could not find a late leveller. Defeat in their first league game since winning the Johnstone's Paint Trophy means Barnsley are now six points off the League One play-off positions. Chesterfield, meanwhile, have now opened up a four-point gap between themselves and the relegation places.\n",
      "\n",
      "Result:\n",
      "Chesterfield climbed out of the League One relegation zone with victory over 10-man Barnsley, who had a man sent off late on.\n"
